## Summary

Fantasy Stock Trade is an application the allows you the manage your holdings. The main objective of this project is to server as a learning tool, and familiarize myself with Expressjs for implementing an API using Postgresql(now Mongodb) as a Database, and consuming an external API as IEX Cloud, using React, and JsonWebtoken for authentication users, and jest and supertest for testing the API.
